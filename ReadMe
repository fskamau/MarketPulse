**GeoEstate Pulse** is a Python-based geospatial analytics tool designed to scrape real estate rental/sale listings, calculate property valuations, and visualize market momentum. Instead of relying on static charts, this tool utilizes **Folium** to plot coordinates on an interactive HTML map, highlighting neighborhoods experiencing the highest price-per-square-foot growth over a 30-day rolling window.

## 🚀 The "Level Up"

Standard web scraping projects often dump data into a CSV or a basic Matplotlib bar chart. **GeoEstate Pulse** takes it a step further by introducing **Geospatial Data Visualization**. By mapping pandas coordinates into interactive HTML layers, users can visually pinpoint where market inflation or deflation is occurring at a granular, neighborhood level.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features

| Tool | Role in Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BeautifulSoup4** | Data Extraction | Parses target real estate sites to extract pricing, square footage, and location tags. |
| **Pandas** | Data Engineering | Cleans unstructured data, calculates Price-Per-SqFt, and computes 30-day percentage growth. |
| **Folium** | Geospatial UI | Translates latitude/longitude coordinates into interactive markers and heatmaps. |

* **Metric Engine:** Automatically standardizes property prices by calculating `$ / sq. ft.`
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Compares current listing batches against 30-day historical data.
* **Smart Mapping:** Color-codes map markers dynamically based on growth percentages (e.g., green for high appreciation).
